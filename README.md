# Data Mining Project – Football Clubs Analysis
The goal of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze a dataset on football clubs in order to extract valuable insights using data mining techniques.
- `male_teams.csv`: The raw dataset used.

## Project Objectives
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, standardization)
- Exploratory data analysis (visualizations, PCA)
- Model application:
  - **Supervised**: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors
  - **Unsupervised**: K-Means, DBSCAN
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, silhouette score…)

## Key Findings
- Supervised models achieved high accuracy (> 99%)
- DBSCAN clustering revealed meaningful structures in unlabeled data

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Author
- Maroua Boumchich – Master's Student in Computer Science
